This is a short set of slides designed to introduce a technical
audience to Git.

To build the slides, you need to install [landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide).
Then just run:

    $ landslide git.cfg

to generate a `presentation.html` which should be viewable in any HTML5 compliant browser.
